# batch_ICS_to_CSV
Convert multiple ICS files into a single CSV output

To extract past events, some websites allows export of data from the calendar view (i.e. https://www.gicc.com/events/list/?tribe_paged=2&tribe_event_display=past) as ICS files.  This program will open all the ICS files stored within a designated folder to extract relevant events data and export values into a single CSV file.
